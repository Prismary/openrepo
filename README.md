# openrepo

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/Prismary/openrepo.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/Prismary/openrepo)

A h5ai fork for my web repositories.
HTTP web server index for Apache httpd, lighttpd, and nginx.

* Do **not** install any files from the `src` folder, they need to be
  preprocessed to work correctly!

## Build

To build **openrepo** yourself either `git clone` or
download the repository. From within the root folder run the following
commands to find a fresh zipball in folder `build` (tested on linux only,
requires `node 10.0+` to be installed, might work on other
configurations).

~~~sh
> npm install
> npm run build
~~~

Refer to the [master](https://github.com/lrsjng/h5ai) branch for more info.
